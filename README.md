linuxdots
=========

It is highly recommended that you install [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) first.
#### Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lovelock/linuxdots.git
$ mv linuxdots/* ~/.
$ rm -rf linuxdots
$ source ~/.zshrc
```
Enjoy it.

These are my favourite Arch Linux configuration files. They are universal and should work with most of the existing Linux distros. Now I used them both in my Archbox on physical machine and Debian sid on virtual machine.

The more I use vim, the harder I can get used to the philosophy and keybindings of emacs ---- though I know both of them are remarkable artwork.

zsh is another wonderful tool I've come up with. I give it some more configurations based on the most popular zsh configuration files, i.e. oh-my-zsh.

Most of the vim plugins are installed with Vundle. So actually you don't have to clone the .vim directory.
