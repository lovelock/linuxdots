My favourite Arch Linux configuration files. They are universal and should work with most of the existing Linux distros. Now I used them both in my Archbox on physical machine and Debian sid on virtual machine.

The more I use vim, the harder I can get used to the philosophy and keybindings of emacs ---- though I know both of them are remarkable artwork.

zsh is another wonderful tool I've come up with. I give it some more configurations based on the most popular zsh configuration files, i.e. oh-my-zsh.
