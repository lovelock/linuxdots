They are universal and should work with most of the existing Linux distros. Now I used them both in my Archbox on physical machine and Debian sid on virtual machine.\r\n\r\nThe more I use vim, the harder I can get used to the philosophy and keybindings of emacs ---- though I know both of them are remarkable artwork.\r\n\r\nzsh is another wonderful tool I've come up with. I give it some more configurations based on the most popular zsh configuration files, i.e. oh-my-zsh.\r\n\r\nMost of the vim plugins are installed with Vundle. So actually you don't have to clone the .vim directory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
